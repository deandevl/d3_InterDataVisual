# d3_InterDataVisual
Contains chapter exercises of d3 visuals from "Interactive Data Visualization for the Web" by Scott Murray.

Book description:

 Create and publish your own interactive data visualization projects on  the Web, even if you have no experience with either web development or  data visualization. It's easy with this hands-on guide. You'll start  with an overview of data visualization concepts and simple web  technologies, and then learn how to use [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), a JavaScript library that lets you express data as visual elements in a web page. 

 Interactive Data Visualization for the Web makes these skills available  at an introductory level for designers and visual artists without  programming experience, journalists interested in the emerging data  journalism processes, and others keenly interested in visualization and  publicly available data sources.
